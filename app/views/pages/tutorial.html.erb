        <h3><strong>How do I pick the right indoor plants? </strong>üå∑üåºüåµ</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Indoor plants are plants that grow indoors. There are a variety of tropical plants, like palms, that thrive in indoor environments.
          <br>
          Most of the time, indoor plants are already in containers, so there is no need to plant them.
          <br>
          <br>
          A good root system ‚Äì This is incredibly important when choosing a plant. It‚Äôs not practical to pull a plant out of its pot to check its roots but if it is a small plant, this can be done.
          <br>
          Healthy roots are thick and light in color.
          <br>
          Foliage- Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb when it comes to plant‚Äôs foliage: if you can‚Äôt see through it, the foliage is thick enough.
          Check for disease ‚Äì Some signs of a plant with pests or disease are: white dots, sticky residue on the leaves and a bad odor.

          How do I get rid of bugs on indoor plants?
          <br>
          <br>
          Bugs on your indoor plants can be really annoying! If you spot pests, go to a garden center and purchase an insecticidal soap, which usually is contained in a spray bottle. When you notice bugs, spray the entire plant ‚Äì the undersides and tops of the leaves as well as the stem. Next, wait about two weeks and repeat the spraying. Then, wait two more weeks and spray again.
          You will want to spray three times because the soap usually will not eliminate eggs, which could hatch. If your plant is dealing with a severe infestation and you are unable to eradicate the pests, throw out the plant. You can also use a damp paper towel to remove a pest.

          Go to a garden center and look for a fertilizer with ‚Äúindoor plant‚Äù on the label. You will use less fertilizer for plants inside versus outside, so ensure you use the rate specified for indoor plants.
          If you‚Äôre getting fertilizer for blooming plants, look for a fertilizer labeled with the type of plant (orchids, for example) ‚Äì but if it is unclear which one you should pick, it‚Äôs fine to use fertilizer for houseplants.
